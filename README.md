# Setup
After `git clone` ...

### Setup conda environment

- `conda env create -f datascience_env.yml` inside the repo
- `conda activate data_science` to activate env (also has to be done in VS Code!)
  - Check if Editor/Ide/Jupyter uses correct env and python-interpreter
  - `conda list` to check packages
- Maybe need to integrate conda-env into jupyter notebook/lab
